This project is me learning Python Pandas and doing a tutorial project while adding my own ideas and changes by looking into the data more. 
For example I have used Seaborn to customize data visualizations and view more specific trends. This is not completed yet and is still ongoing
This is a Python Pandas project that follows https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMOA1pPVUc4&t=4073s and https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks
